# House Price Prediction App

This project is a house price prediction web application built using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit. The app predicts house sale prices based on a linear regression model trained on the Kaggle House Prices dataset with a log-transformed target variable.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - One-hot encoding of the 'Neighborhood' feature.
  - Log transformation of the target variable to reduce skewness.
- **Model Training:**  
  - Linear Regression with evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RÂ²).
- **Interactive Web App:**  
  - A user-friendly interface for entering house features.
  - Live prediction of sale prices.
